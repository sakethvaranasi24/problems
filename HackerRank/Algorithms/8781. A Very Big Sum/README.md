## Problem

In this challenge, you need to calculate and print the sum of elements in an array, considering that some integers may be very large.

**Function Description**

Complete the $aVeryBigSum$ function with the following parameter(s):

- $int\ ar[n]$: an array of integers  

**Return**

- $long$: the sum of the array elements

**Input Format** 

The first line of the input consists of an integer $n$.  
The next line contains $n$ space-separated integers contained in the array. 

**Output Format**

Return the integer sum of the elements in the array.

**Constraints**  
$1 \le n \le 10$  
$0 \le ar[i] \le 10^{10}$  

**Sample Input**  

    STDIN                                                   Function
    -----                                                   --------
    5                                                       arr[] size n = 5
    1000000001 1000000002 1000000003 1000000004 1000000005  arr[...]  
    

**Output**   
	
    5000000015

**Note:** 

The range of the 32-bit integer is $(-2^{31}) ~to~  (2^{31} -1)~ or~ [-2147483648,2147483647]$.   

When we add several integer values, the resulting sum might exceed the above range. You might need to use long int C/C++/Java to store such sums.
